    <p class="p_big">What is it we're <i>really</i> striving for?</p>
    <p> Calliope Callista is an empty-hearted, exhausted CIA agent struggling to confront her regretful past. Forced to pick up the dirteist of work due to her incredible talents, she can't help but wish she didn't throw everything she loved away to climb the ranks like she did. When a shady CIA insider offers her a legitimate way out of the buisness, Calliope hesitantly takes up the offer, hoping that she isn't trekking down the same, rotten dirt path as before. </p>

    <p> White Butterflies is currently in the early stages of brainstorming, but I am in high hopes of making geniune progress over the early months of 2025! I do not yet have a way for those interested to stay posted, but be sure to check this webpage every once in a while for when I do!</p>
